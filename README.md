# Installation / Setup

* Download the files into a folder of your choice. I recommend calling the new folder "weather-app".
* Open a new terminal window.
* Navigate to your newly created folder (called "weather-app")
* Create your API Keys from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) and [GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)
* Paste YOUR keys into the "apiExample.js" file
* Rename the "apiExample.js" file to "api.js"
* Run the command ``` npm install ```
* Once the installation is complete, you can run the command ``` npm start ``` to get React started
* You should see the following

# API KEYS

You need an API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) and [GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities) to run this application.

To run, you must add the correct api keys in the file "api.js"

An example of format is included in "apiExample.js". Feel free to add you API Keys in the correct areas, then rename the file "api.js".
